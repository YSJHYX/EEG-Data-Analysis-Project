    "The rapid development of online education, particularly through Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), has opened up more opportunities for students worldwide to access a diverse range of study resources. However, unlike traditional classrooms that facilitate active interactions between instructors and students, online learning often lacks immediate feedback mechanisms. This limitation can make it difficult to identify and address moments of student confusion, which can hinder comprehension and motivation if left unresolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tackle this issue, recent research has explored the use of electroencephalography (EEG) technology to detect cognitive states such as confusion in online learning environments. In the paper Using EEG to Improve Massive Open Online Courses Feedback Interaction, Wang et al. conducted a pilot study investigating the potential of EEG-based methods for identifying confusion among students while viewing MOOC videos. During the study, EEG data was collected from students as they watched video clips designed to evoke varying levels of comprehension—from basic topics assumed to be clear for college students (e.g., introductory algebra) to more complex subjects (e.g., quantum mechanics and stem cell research). Using a single-channel EEG device, the researchers captured data on brain activity from the frontal lobe, a region associated with cognitive processing and emotional response. Afterward, students self-reported their confusion levels on a scale from 1 (least confusing) to 7 (most confusing), generating both predefined and self-reported labels of confusion. By training machine learning classifiers on the EEG data, the researchers demonstrated a moderate ability to distinguish between confusing and non-confusing experiences, achieving accuracies that, while limited, were above random chance and comparable to human observers interpreting student body language.1 These findings suggest the feasibility of EEG technology as a tool for detecting confusion in educational settings, which could support more adaptive and responsive online learning environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project builds upon Wang et al.'s foundational work by applying EEG data analysis to further understand and classify confusion states in students. Similar to their study design, we utilize a dataset containing EEG data collected from 10 college students while they engage with educational video clips that range from basic to complex topics. We analyze the average EEG signals with higher frequency data over every 0.5 seconds as students watch these videos, alongside their self-reported confusion ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on provious works, different brain wave frequencies are associated with different cognitive states (Kaushik et al).\n",
    "\n",
    "Theta Waves (4–8 Hz): Theta waves are often associated with memory formation, learning, and attention. Alpha Waves (8–13 Hz): Alpha waves are most commonly linked to relaxation and reduced attentional demands. Beta Waves (13–28 Hz): Beta waves are generally associated with active cognitive processing and engagement in problem-solving tasks.2 Therefore, By monitoring shifts in these frequency bands, we could potentially predict instances of confusion in real time, enabling insights into how students process and react to different educational stimuli.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing this EEG recording data, our project aims to use students’ confusion score ratings to build machine learning models that accurately classify instances of student confusion. The insights gained could support the future development of applications in online education, such as real-time adaptive learning systems that adjust content based on student engagement and cognitive load. Ultimately, this project seeks to contribute to a more personalized and effective online learning experience, utilizing EEG data to bridge the feedback gap inherent in remote education.\n",

    "We hypothesize that by recording EEG data while students watch lecture videos, we can predict moments of confusion. Specifically, we predict that beta (12-29 Hz) and gamma (30-100 Hz) band activity will increase as confusion intensifies, with a 20% or greater rise in power from baseline levels during moments of high cognitive load. This increase will enable us to classify confusion instances accurately. We expect beta waves to correlate with heightened cognitive engagement, as students attempt to process complex information, while gamma activity may reflect the effort involved in integrating and making sense of new content. To quantify these changes, we will measure the percent change in power across these bands and establish a threshold (e.g., 0.5 correlation coefficient) for significant associations with confusion scores. We will use statistical tests (e.g., t-tests) to confirm that the observed increases differ significantly from baseline and conduct a classification analysis to determine the predictive accuracy of EEG patterns in identifying confusion states."

These metrics are proxies for cognitive states, with frequencies like Theta and Beta potentially indicating levels of focus or confusion. The variable we try to predict is user-definedlabeln, which represents confusion level, 1 is confused and 0 is not confused. Data types include floats. Preprocessing steps might involve handling missing values, normalizing EEG signals, and converting categorical columns from float to integer data types for model input.\n",

Data types are likely to be a mix of integers (for IDs and age), categorical (for gender and education level), and strings or floats for other characteristics. Preprocessing would involve cleaning categorical data, encoding categorical variables as needed, and ensuring IDs match those in the EEG dataset for accurate merging.\n",

Then, include your group’s expectations of one another for successful completion of your COGS108 project below. Discuss and agree on what all of your expectations are. Discuss how your team will communicate throughout the quarter and consider how you will communicate respectfully should conflicts arise. By including each member’s name above and by adding their name to the submission, you are indicating that you have read the COGS108 Team Policies, accept your team’s expectations below, and have every intention to fulfill them. These expectations are for your team’s use and benefit — they won’t be graded for their details.\n",

    "* *Team Expectation 1* Ensure data accuracy and privacy - Everyone on the team is responsible for the accuracy of the data, especially the data collection and processing process, to ensure that the records are standardized and there are no omissions or errors. The privacy of participants is a top priority, and all collected data must be processed and stored in strict accordance with ethical requirements, so that the data is anonymized to avoid any risk of privacy disclosure.\n",
    "* *Team Expectation 2* Clear communication and transparent information - Team members need to maintain good communication and meet at least once a week to share their progress, difficulties, and support needs. Each member should actively participate in the meeting to ensure that everyone is aware of what other members are working on and the overall project progress. All information should be shared as transparently and timely as possible, such as unexpected situations in data collection, questions in analysis, etc., to avoid information lag affecting the progress.\n",
    "* *Team Expecation 3* Flexible adjustment, strong adaptability - During the course of the project, new discoveries or methodological adjustments may be encountered, and team members should remain flexible and adjust the research method according to the actual situation. For example, if a preliminary analysis finds that certain EEG signals are more significant, the team may need to focus on analyzing those signals. We need to actively adapt to new technical requirements, such as the development of real-time inspection systems, or the optimization of data analysis methods."
