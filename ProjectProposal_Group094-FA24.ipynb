    "Currently, the rapid development of online education, particularly Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), brings more possibilities to worldwide students who want to access more study resources. But, compared to traditional classrooms, "
    "where students can have active interaction with their instructors and classmates, online learning lacks these immediate feedback mechanisms, which makes it challenging to identify and address moments of student confusion—a state that can hinder students’ comprehension and motivation if left unresolved. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to address this problem, recent research has explored the use of electroencephalography (EEG) technology to detect cognitive states such as confusion in online learning contexts. In the research paper *Using EEG to Improve Massive Open Online Courses Feedback Interaction*, "
    "Wang et al. conducted a pilot study investigating the potential of EEG-based methods to identify confusion in students while they viewed MOOC videos. In their study, EEG data was collected from students as they watched video clips designed to evoke varying levels of comprehension, "
    "from basic topics that are assumed to be not confusing for a college student (e.g., introductory algebra) to more complex and potentially confusing subjects (e.g., quantum mechanics and stem cell research). They used a single-channel EEG device, the study captured data on student brain activity from the frontal lobe,"
    "a region associated with cognitive processing and emotional response. Then, students in Wang et al.’s study self-reported their confusion levels on a scale from 1 (least confusing) to 7 (most confusing), creating both predefined and self-reported labels of confusion. "
    "By training machine learning classifiers on EEG data, the researchers demonstrated a moderate ability to distinguish between confusing and non-confusing experiences, achieving accuracies that, while limited, were above random chance and comparable to ratings by human observers who interpreted student body language.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) These findings suggest the feasibility of EEG technology as a tool to detect confusion in educational settings, which could support more adaptive and responsive online learning environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project builds upon Wang et al.’s foundational work by applying EEG data analysis to further understand and classify confusion states in students. Similar to Wang et al.’s study design, we use the dataset containing EGG data collected from 10 college students while they watch educational video clips that range from basic to complex topics," 
    "the average of EEG signals with higher frequency data over every 0.5 seconds as students engage with these videos, and student’s self-reported confusion rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing this data, this project aims to use students’ confusion score ratings to build machine-learning models that accurately classify instances of student confusion. The insights gained from this could support future development and applications in online education,"
    "such as real-time adaptive learning systems that adjust content based on student engagement and cognitive load. Ultimately, this project seeks to contribute to a more personalized and effective online learning experience, utilizing EEG data to bridge the feedback gap inherent in remote education.\n",
